Proof assistants such as Isabelle/HOL, Coq, Lean, and HOL4 help construct machine-checked proofs.
Isabelle/HOL is based on Higher-Order Logic and integrates automation (e.g., Sledgehammer).
Coq uses the Calculus of Inductive Constructions with dependent types and program extraction.
Lean combines theorem proving and programming with mathlib and tactic frameworks.
