Proof assistants are tools for constructing formal proofs by computer. 
Examples include Coq, Isabelle/HOL, Lean, and HOL4. 

- Coq: Uses Gallina (functional language with dependent types). 
  Allows extraction of verified code to OCaml, Haskell.
- Isabelle/HOL: Based on Higher-Order Logic, with strong automation via Sledgehammer.
- Lean: Supports dependent type theory, widely used for math (mathlib).
- HOL4: Classical higher-order logic system.

Applications:
• Formal verification of software & hardware
• Mathematics (Four Color Theorem, Odd Order Theorem)
• Security protocols
