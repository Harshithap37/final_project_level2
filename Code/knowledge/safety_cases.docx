Safety cases are structured arguments that a system is acceptably safe.

Elements:
1. Goal (Claim about safety)
2. Strategy (Reasoning approach)
3. Evidence (Tests, proofs, analysis)

Formal methods support safety cases by:
- Providing mathematical evidence
- Reducing human error
- Enabling certification (DO-178C, ISO 26262)

Limitations:
- Steep learning curve
- High upfront cost
